## Demo:

- [Frontend (Next.js)](https://workshops-16-17-production.up.railway.app/)
- [Admin Panel (React)](https://admin-panel-production-3ed0.up.railway.app/)
- [Backend](https://backend-production-df90.up.railway.app/api)

### Application

Run `npx nx serve frontend` and open browser at http://localhost:4200

### Env variables (.env.local or on your server)

`DATABASE_URL` - url string to your database

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - you will get this in your Clerk.com account
`CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - you will get this in your Clerk.com account

### Storybook

Run `npx nx storybook frontend` and open browser at http://localhost:4400/

## Common UI library

### Storybook

Run `npx nx storybook common-ui` and open browser at http://localhost:4600/

## Admin Panel

Run `npx nx serve admin-panel` and open browser at http://localhost:4800/

### Env variables (.env.local or on your server)

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` - URL to the backend e.g:

```sh
VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
```

## Backend

Run `npx nx serve backend` and server will listen to requests at http://localhost:3000/api

### Env variables (.env.local or on your server)

`DATABASE_URL` - url string to your database

## Prisma

Run `npx nx run prisma:generate-types` to generate types

To run migrations in interactive mode you can change directory to: prisma/src/lib/, export DATABASE_URL variable (see below) and run:

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
